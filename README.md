<h1>Top Five Near Me WordPress Plug-in</h1>

<p>Hi there!</p>

<p>This is a WordPress plug-in that displays the top five rated restaurants in the user's location.</p>

<p>The shortcode that generates the output contains attributes for both restaurant food type and location, if the website administrator would like to show case specific restaurants.</p>

<p>This WordPress plug-in uses:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3/authentication" target="_blank">Yelp Fusion API</a> for restaurants information and ratings</li>
  <li><a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/adding-a-google-map" target="_blank">Google Maps API</a> for geolocation</li>
</ul>
